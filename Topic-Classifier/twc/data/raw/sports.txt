Lightweight Arsenal fail to pack a punch on Arsène Wenger’s big night
Who do you think will reach the UCL Final and win it?
Heung Min-Son been named Best Footballer in Asia for the 3rd time.
Wenger: “If God exists &amp; one day I go up there and he will ask: ‘What have you done in your life?’. The only answer I will have is: ‘I tried to win football games.’ He will say: ‘Is that all?’ And the answer I will have is: ‘It’s not as easy as it looks.’”

Wenger on future plans: "Honestly I don’t know what I will do. Will I take a little rest? I will continue to work, that is for sure."
There were clashes between Liverpool and Roma supporters shortly before kick-off.
Dele ‘We Can’t keep doing this’
Wenger effectively admits he was forced out of Arsenal. Asked why he is going now when he has a contract to 2019, he says: "The timing was not really my decision. For the rest, I have spoken about it already."
Is Salah the new best player??
Arsene Wenger says timing of his departure from Arsenal “not really my decision”. Says he has high opinion of Luis Enrique but doesn’t want to influence decision on who replaces him
Arsene Wenger: Timing of Arsenal departure 'not really my decision'
Di Francesco:"Against Barca, we played as a team, we didn't focus on [Lionel] Messi and, by playing in this way, we can achieve great things. "We can't win this game by only stopping one player, we need to focus as a team. Liverpool is not only Salah, Liverpool has a number of good players. "

Heung Min-Son been named Best Footballer in Asia for the 3rd time.
Wenger: “If God exists &amp; one day I go up there and he will ask: ‘What have you done in your life?’. The only answer I will have is: ‘I tried to win football games.’ He will say: ‘Is that all?’ And the answer I will have is: ‘It’s not as easy as it looks.’”

Pogba:“Who is the Daily Mail? I don’t know them. You know if I was to listen to everyone, then I would be going to Marseille, Amiens or Rennes, Manchester City, Real Madrid, I would be everywhere… For the moment I am at Manchester United. I am only thinking about the present."
